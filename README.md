# ASCII GIF RENDERER

The proposal of this project is to create a library that animates gifs in the terminal with sufficient functions to be useful in TUIs.

## TO-DO

- Animate a gif âœ…
- Make it possible to interupt a gif without closing the program
- Make it possible to animate multiple gifs simultaneously
- Allow GIFs to be created automatically by reading from text files, instead of them being created manually
